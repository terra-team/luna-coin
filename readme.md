# Terra migration guides
Terra 2.0 is Here

This is a fraud coin. Luna, which has collapsed thousands of times, has been renamed as lunc, and the project party continues to fraud by reusing the name Luna. After the crash, it can even derive lunb, Lund, lune, lunf Lunz, if you want to be a fool, please continue. Otherwise, I suggest you leave the virtual currency

The only reason to buy $LUNA 2.0 is to qualify for the next airdrop of $LUNA 3.0 after it goes to zero like $LUNA 1.0

## What is Terra?

**[Terra](https://terra.money)** is a public, open-source, proof-of-stake blockchain. **The Terra Core** is the reference implementation of the Terra protocol written in Golang. The Terra Core is powered by the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) BFT consensus.

## Installation

### From Binary

The easiest way to install the Terra Core is to download a pre-built binary. You can find the latest binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/terra-money/core/releases) page.

### From Source

**Step 1: Install Golang**

Go v1.18+ or higher is required for The Terra Core.

1. Install [Go 1.18+ from the official site](https://go.dev/dl/). Ensure that your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables are properly set up by using the following commands:

   For Windows:

   ```sh
   wget <https://golang.org/dl/go1.18.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz>
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.18.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

   For Mac:

   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

2. Confirm your Go installation by checking the version:

   ```sh
   go version
   ```


**Step 2: Get Terra Core source code**

Clone the Terra Core from the [official repo](https://github.com/terra-money/core/) and check out the `main` branch for the latest stable release.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terra-money/core/
cd core
git checkout main
```

**Step 3: Build Terra core**

Run the following command to install `terrad` to your `GOPATH` and build the Terra Core. `terrad` is the node daemon and CLI for interacting with a Terra node.

```bash
# COSMOS_BUILD_OPTIONS=rocksdb make install
make install
```

**Step 4: Verify your installation**

Verify your installation with the following command:

```bash
terrad version --long
```

A successful installation will return the following:

```bash
name: terra
server_name: terrad
version: <x.x.x>
commit: <Commit hash>
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.18.2 darwin/amd64
```

## `terrad`

`terrad` is the all-in-one CLI and node daemon for interacting with the Terra blockchain. 

To view various subcommands and their expected arguments, use the following command:

``` sh
$ terrad --help
```

```

Visit the [terrad documentation page](https://docs.terra.money/docs/develop/how-to/terrad/README.html) for more info on usage. 


## Node Setup

Once you have `terrad` installed, you will need to set up your node to be part of the network.

### Join the mainnet

The following requirements are recommended for running a mainnet node:

- Four or more CPU cores
- At least 32 GB of memory
- At least 300 mbps of network bandwidth
- At least 2 TB NVME SSD
- A Linux distribution

### Terra node quickstart
```
terrad init nodename
wget -O ~/.terra/config/genesis.json https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmZAMcdu85Qr8saFuNpL9VaxVqqLGWNAs72RVFhchL9jWs
curl https://network.terra.dev/addrbook.json > ~/.terrad/config/addrbook.json
terrad start
```

### Join a testnet

Several testnets might exist simultaneously. Ensure that your version of `terrad` is compatible with the network you want to join.

To set up a node on the latest testnet, visit [the testnet repo](https://github.com/terra-money/testnet).

#### Run a local testnet

The easiest way to set up a local testing environment is to run [LocalTerra](https://github.com/terra-money/LocalTerra), a zero-configuration complete testing environment. 

### Run a single node testnet

You can also run a local testnet using a single node. On a local testnet, you will be the sole validator signing blocks.

**Step 1: Create network and account**

First, initialize your genesis file to bootstrap your network. Create a name for your local testnet and provide a moniker to refer to your node:

```bash
terrad init --chain-id=<testnet_name> <node_moniker>
```

Next, create a Terra account by running the following command:

```bash
terrad keys add <account_name>
```

**Step 2: Add account to genesis**

Add your account to genesis and set an initial balance to start. Run the following commands to add your account and set the initial balance:

```bash
terrad add-genesis-account $(terrad keys show <account_name> -a) 100000000uluna
terrad gentx <account_name> 10000000uluna --chain-id=<testnet_name>
terrad collect-gentxs
```

**Step 3: Run terrad**

Now you can start your private Terra network:

```bash
terrad start
```

Your `terrad` node will be running a node on `tcp://localhost:26656`, listening for incoming transactions and signing blocks.

## Set up a production environment

**Note**: This guide only covers general settings for a production-level full node. Visit the [Terra validator's guide](https://docs.terra.money/docs/full-node/manage-a-terra-validator/README.html) for more information.

**This guide has been tested against Linux distributions only. To ensure you successfully set up your production environment, consider setting it up on an Linux system.**

### Increase maximum open files

By default, `terrad` can't open more than 1024 files at once.

You can increase this limit by modifying `/etc/security/limits.conf` and raising the `nofile` capability.

```
*                soft    nofile          65535
*                hard    nofile          65535
```

### Create a dedicated user

It is recommended that you run `terrad` as a normal user. Super-user accounts are only recommended during setup to create and modify files.

### Port configuration

`terrad` uses several TCP ports for different purposes.

- `26656`: The default port for the P2P protocol. Use this port to communicate with other nodes. While this port must be open to join a network, it does not have to be open to the public. Validator nodes should configure `persistent_peers` and close this port to the public.

- `26657`: The default port for the RPC protocol. This port is used for querying / sending transactions and must be open to serve queries from `terrad`. **DO NOT** open this port to the public unless you are planning to run a public node.

- `1317`: The default port for [Lite Client Daemon](https://docs.terra.money/docs/develop/how-to/start-lcd.html) (LCD), which can be enabled in `~/.terra/config/app.toml`. The LCD provides an HTTP RESTful API layer to allow applications and services to interact with your `terrad` instance through RPC. Check the [Terra REST API](https://lcd.terra.dev/swagger/#/) for usage examples. Don't open this port unless you need to use the LCD.

- `26660`: The default port for interacting with the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) database. You can use Promethues to monitor an environment. This port is closed by default.

### Run the server as a daemon

**Important**:

Keep `terrad` running at all times. The simplest solution is to register `terrad` as a `systemd` service so that it automatically starts after system reboots and other events.


### Register terrad as a service

First, create a service definition file in `/etc/systemd/system`.

**Sample file: `/etc/systemd/system/terrad.service`**

```
[Unit]
Description=Terra Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=terra
ExecStart=/data/terra/go/bin/terrad start
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65535
```

Modify the `Service` section from the given sample above to suit your settings.
Note that even if you raised the number of open files for a process, you still need to include `LimitNOFILE`.

After creating a service definition file, you should execute `systemctl daemon-reload`.

### Start, stop, or restart service

Use `systemctl` to control (start, stop, restart)

```bash
# Start
systemctl start terrad
# Stop
systemctl stop terrad
# Restart
systemctl restart terrad
```

### Access logs

```bash
# Entire log
journalctl -t terrad
# Entire log reversed
journalctl -t terrad -r
# Latest and continuous
journalctl -t terrad -f
```
